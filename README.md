# Car Price Dataset EDA

## Overview
This project explores cleaned car price data to uncover patterns and insights using Python. Through summary statistics, visualizations, and clear code, youâ€™ll find trends in price, relationships between features, and key takeaways for analysis or modeling.

## Repository Structure

- `data/cleaned_sample.csv`: Example cleaned dataset sample (no proprietary data included)
- `notebook/Car_price_EDA.ipynb`: Main notebook for analysis and visualization
- `visuals/`: Contains exported charts and graphs
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages

## Key EDA Steps

- Overview of all variables
- Price distribution and outlier detection
- Categorical analysis (e.g., by make or model)
- Correlation heatmap for numeric features
- Visual exploration (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots)
- Insights and next steps

All steps, code, and commentary are in the notebook.
